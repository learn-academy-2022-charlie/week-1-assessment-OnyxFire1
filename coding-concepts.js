// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
// const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// // console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// // a) Your answer:
// // b) Verify and explain:


// --------------------1) What will this log?

// const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
// console.log(cohort.length)


// a) Your answer: The answer to Learn 2022 should be 10 becuase the string is five character, the space which is data and 2022
// b) Verify and explain: After running the code the answer was 10


// --------------------2) What will this log?

// const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])


// a) Your answer: The answer should be "o" in Hello because the index is 4
// b) Verify and explain: The index gives the position of the first occurrency and that first occurence would be "o"


// --------------------3) What will this log?

// const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
// const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: Since index is 1 the answer should be Ruby
// b) Verify and explain: The correct answer is Ruby based on the same index explanation in question 2


// --------------------4) What will this log?

// const weekendDays = ("saturday", "sunday")
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: I expected to get Saturday in lower case and Sunday in caps.
// b) Verify and explain: I removed the square bracketts and repalced it with parenthesis but only Sunday in caps returned. Probably had to type out the command instead of hitting the up arrow.


// --------------------5) What will this log?

// const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: The answer should be number because .length deals with number
// b) Verify and explain: I ran the code in terminal as is and the right answer was number, however I removed typeof and the answer came back 3
