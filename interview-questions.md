# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Based on my basic understanding of Git, it is software. The difference between git and Github is that git is software and Github is where information is stored, basically the Cloud.

  Researched answer: Out of all the version control systems Git is the most commonly used, it is popular because it can keep track of any changes made and a user is able to go to a specific location if needed.

  Github is a collaborating platform that allows work to be done on a project with other software developers.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: The JavaScript operators that return Boolean values are And, Or, Not. The And is denoted with double ampersands, the Or is denoted with two lines (forget what there called) and the Not is denoted with a bang operator, which Iâ€™ve always known to be an exclamation point. Boolean values are a way to get  a true/false return in JavaScript.

  Researched answer: The  Boolean values of true/value will return an 1 for True or  0 for False, sometimes you can get a value of Null which is an expression that is not zero, it is nothing.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a particular location in an array, the number order starts at zero. The difference between an an index and a value is that an index puts like variables in one location a value is content.

  Researched answer: An array keeps like objects stored under the same name inside brackets. The output should be defined by the order in which the variables placed in the array starting at zero.

  The difference between an index and a value is that an index keeps like variables in a particular location, whereas a value allows a software engineer to work with large amount  of information without getting lost.




4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is doing the same thing over and over again until you get results.

  Researched answer: In development the iteration is used to put in order  a set of symbols in a certain environment until that specific issue has been obtained or not obtained. 




5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The driver is the person who is basically being directed by the Navigator, this is where active listening plays and important role. The driver is dependent on the navigator to get them both from one destination to another.

  The Navigator is directing the driver. In this role the navigator is hands off, there is no interacting with his/her computer in this role.  The navigator is giving direction from documents they have in front of them.

  In both roles active listening and productive communicating is key because both individuals will be bouncing ideas off each other to finalize a product.


  Researched answer: The drive is responsible for writing the code and the navigator is responsible for making sure the correct code is being written.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Built in methods in JavaScript that affects arrays, function as an argument.


2. Jest: A framework that makes corrections to JavaScript

3. Objects: A self-sustaining item with a certain group and effect.

4. Method: A task  that is included  to an object or set of directions to complete  a goal.

5. Classes: Pieces of code that encloses more that one object and allows control for variables.
